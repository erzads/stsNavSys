# stsNavSys
NavSys - Slay the spire mod that summarizes available paths

## Features
Analyses every possible path from a given location and displays a list with each node count.

Hovering on the summary will highlight the path.

## Presets
* There is a hard cap at 15 results to prevent too much info.
* Paths with the same amount of nodes per type are removed (dupes).
* Paths are sorted by sum of rest sites and elites, then by elites, then by rest sites.
